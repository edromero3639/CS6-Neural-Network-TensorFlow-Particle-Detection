# CS6-Neural-Network-TensorFlow-Particle-Detection
We were requested to build a dense neural network to detect a new particle based on a binary classification were 1 symbolizes a detection and 0 means non-detection. Accuracy is the measurement we will use, and the goal will be to create the most accurate prediction model.
